## Background
Stock Fedora 30 Docker image with a default user for automation testing.

## How to Build this Image

This image is built automatically on Docker Hub any time a commit is made or code is merged to the `master` branch. However, if you need to need to manually build an image on your workstation, execute the following:
```
make image
```

## How to Run this Container

To run a container from this image, run this command:
```
make run
```

## How to Clean Up
To remove both the local container and image, run this command:
```
make clean
```

## Disclaimer 

This image is used to test build automation scripts. It is most definitely not suitable nor secure enough to run in any production environment.
